Test scrip for the implementation of the predict_ssvep_data module. This script ...

e.g. description of test module:
loads the data from the data dictionary, 
followed by the design of two bandpass FIR filters centered around 12hz and 15hz. The filter taps are then used to convolve
it with the EEG data contained in the "data" dictionary. A Hilbert transform extracts the envelope of the oscillatory signals, then
the envelope and the event types are ploted on a single grapth. As a final step, the power spectrum of the raw EEG , filtered and 
envelope is ploted for the 'Oz" and 'Fz' EEG channels.
